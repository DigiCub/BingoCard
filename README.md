# BingoCard

A simple bingo card generator.

Modifications can be made in bingo.js

centerFree sets a dedicated "Free Space" in the center of the card when it's set to TRUE.
If it's false, it uses the values in the spaceData variable. A "Free Space" entry can be added
to spaceData if you want a random floating free space

emptySpace is the text used to fill the rest of the card if spaceData doesnt have 25 values in it.
